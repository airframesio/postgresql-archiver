*Development Process*
- Always ensure that the design system (in docs/design-system) is applied to the design of the web UI.
- If new design concepts are introduced, be sure the design system is updated to reflect.

*Release Process*
- All lints must pass, no exceptions. Code must be fixed, don't just add a lint exception.
- All tests must pass, no exceptions.
- IMPORTANT: All code additions/changes require that lint, gofmt, tests, and build are successful.
- The README and CHANGELOG must be updated as necessary.
